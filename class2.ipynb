    "## Class 2 – Going Abstract – 17 Feb 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous class we learned all the basic ingredients of programming (numbers, strings, lists, etc.), as well as the fundamental \"control structures\" (`if`, `for`, and `while`). This small handful of components will allow you to do practically anything – the only limits are your time and imagination! However, there are still some more programming structures that are worth learning. Although these new structures are less fundamental, they will help you to organize your code into discrete, modular chunks that are easier to understand and conceptualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in programming is abstraction. This is the idea that we can wrap up a bunch of technical details in a single machine, and then we can forget about all the internal technical details – we just need a high-level understanding of what the machine does. In Python, there are four main levels of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions: Lines of code can be organized into functions that carry out particular procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classes: A bunch of related functions can be organized together in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modules: A bunch of functions and classes can be organized together in a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Packages: A bunch of modules can be organized together in a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move up the hierarchy, towards the more abstract levels, we can forget about the nitty-gritty details at the lower levels and focus on more general concepts. Likewise, as we move down the hierarchy we can zoom in to more technical details. For example, the [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org) package, which is used for running experiments, is comprised of several modules, including one module to deal with timing, another to deal with hardware, and another to deal with sound. Within each module, there are several classes; for example, within the hardware module, you might have classes for dealing with the mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Finally, within classes, there will be multiple functions (technically, they're called \"methods\"), which define particular procedures; for example, within the mouse class, there will be methods to access where the mouse is currently positioned or which button is currently being pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I mostly want to look at functions, but we'll also briefly look at some of the higher-level abstractions."

    "You've already used several functions, perhaps without even realizing. For example, you used the `print()` function in order to put stuff on the screen, you used the `len()` function to find out how many items are in a list, and you used the `range()` function to generate a list of counting numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all **\"built-in\" functions** – that is, functions that are a core part of Python. Unlike other languages, Python has a very minimal set of built-in functions; however, there are many useful functions which can be **imported** if you need to use them. More importantly, you can define your own functions. This turns out to be extremely useful for organizing your code and minimizing unnecessary code duplication. It also makes it easier to test and understand your code because you can isolate each part of the machine and understand it independently of everything else. When you become a proficient programmer, 95% of your code will be functions: You define all the functions you need and then you \"conduct\" them as if you were conducting an orchestra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a full list of the built-in functions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html Of these, I think the most commonly used ones are `abs`, `round`, `min`, `max`, `sum`, `sorted`, `reversed`, `enumerate`, and `zip`. Most of these are fairly obvious, but let's take a look at each in turn.\n",

    "This behavior is a little inconvenient sometimes, but the function is designed this way to be more computationally efficient. If you had a list with a billion numbers and tried to reverse it, the computer would have to waste a lot of memory representing two versions of the list: the original list and the reversed version. By creating an iterator object, Python doesn't actually need to create a new list in memory; the iterator object just represents the *concept* of looking at the original list in reverse order. When you iterate over the iterator object, Python just reads the original list in reverse.\n",

If you write something like `range(1, 1000000000001)` (the range of numbers from one to one trillion), the numbers are not actually created in memory. In fact, I'm not sure it's even possible to represent this many numbers in memory simultaneously. If each number requires 64 bits to represent, then you would need 64 trillion bits, which is equivalent to seven thousand gigabytes. To put that in context, my computer has 32 gigabytes of RAM. Nevertheless, Python will quite happily represent the *concept* of a trillion numbers with no problem."

For example, in the code above, it seems like the error happens on line 5; after all, there's a big green arrow pointing to line 5. But, in fact, the real source of the error is in line 3. Putting myself in Python's shoes, I would work through it like this:\n",

    "Here's my advice: Don't get mad if the computer doesn't understand you; keep calm and work backwards through the code! If you need to, print some of the variables to verify that they are indeed equal to what you expect them to be equal to. Pretty soon, you should be able to track down the source of the bug. You might be tempted just to copy and paste *TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable* into Google. This *might* help you, but it might also just confuse you even more; there are many ways this particular error could come about, and the people on Stack Overflow are probably getting this error for totally unrelated reasons. (Nevertheless, please feel free to Google stuff when you get stuck – I do it every day – just be aware of the potential pitfalls)."

Like variables, you can choose whatever name you want, but it's good to choose something descriptive. The name of the function is followed by a set of parentheses which contain the function's **arguments**, or in other words, variable names that will be used to represent the function's inputs. In this case, the function has a single argument `numbers` (note that, although the user will pass in multiple numbers, they only actually pass in one object, a list; thus, the function only takes one input – it has one argument). As you would expect, you are free to choose the argument names. Here I chose the argument name `numbers` because it communicates to the user what I expect them to pass in – a list of numbers. Finally, like `if`, `for`, and `while`, the first line of the function definition ends with a colon (`:`).\n",

The `return` statement specifies the output of the function – the object that will be returned when the function completes. In this case, our `product()` function needs to return... the product, which I represented by the variable `total`.\n",

    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, a collection of related functions can be wrapped up into a class. Classes tend to be a little abstract and difficult to understand for beginners, so I don't want to say too much about them here. It suffices to say that classes define \"objects,\" just like how functions define procedures. In this course, I will focus more on *using* these \"objects\" rather than actually defining them yourself. Personally, I like using classes – in fact, sometimes I worry that I use them a little too much! But the truth is that you can already get pretty far without ever building any of your own classes. That being said, if you're curious, you can look up some online tutorials, like this one: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, a few important things to say on this topic. First, I've been using the word \"object\" several times today without really explaining what this means. Technically, Python is what's known as an **object-oriented language**. This means that Python treats everything as an abstract \"object\" that has certain attributes and methods. Lists are objects, ints are objects, functions are objects, strings are objects, slices are objects, modules are objects... you get the idea...!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason this matters to us is because these objects often have useful **methods** associated with them. We've used one of these methods already: the `.append()` method from the `list` object. Recall from the last class that this allowed us to append an item to the end of a list:"
